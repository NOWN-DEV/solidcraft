# Sheet metal

The SHEET METAL tab builds parts from a sheet of constant thickness under a **sheet metal rule**
(thickness, bend radius, K-factor), set in **Sheet Metal Rules** (`sheet.manage_rules`).

- **Flange** (`sheet.flange`): a base flange from a sketch profile, a contour flange from an open
  sketch, or an edge flange from a part edge.
- **Hem** (`sheet.hem`) and **Fold** (`sheet.fold`) along a sketch line.
- **Unfold / Refold** (`sheet.unfold`, `sheet.refold`) for working on the flat part.
- **Convert** (`sheet.convert`) turns a solid of constant thickness into sheet metal.
- **Create Flat Pattern** (`sheet.flat_pattern`) shows the flat part with its bend lines and a
  bend table, and exports it as DXF or a bend-table CSV through the save picker.

Bends follow the rule's K-factor, so flat lengths match what a press brake will make. Tests
check flat lengths against hand-computed bend allowances.

Where the edge flanges of one feature meet at a corner of the base, their panels are closed
toward each other at any bend angle: each end is cut square to the sheet, on a line in the flat
chosen so that the edges nearest each other (on the inner faces) run parallel, the rule's
**gap** apart, either side of the plane halfway between the flanges. Flanges at 72° get slanted
ends in the flat; corners that aren't square close the same way, and at 90° it is the corner
the rule always gave. A corner that can't be closed (a gap under 0.01 mm, flanges bending
opposite ways, ends that would overlap in the flat pattern) stays open, and the flange feature
reports a warning saying where. A flange added by a later feature leaves the corner as it was:
the earlier flange keeps its length and the new one ends at its bend.

The flanges of one edge flange feature can each have an angle and a height of their own. An
entry of `edges` is a point `[x, y, z]`, which takes the feature's `height` and `angle`, or an
object `{"point": [x, y, z], "angle": "105 deg", "height": "30 mm"}` whose `angle` and `height`
(either one, or both) replace them for that edge. They are expressions like the feature's own,
so parameters work, and each is a feature input of its own (`Edge angle`, `Edge height`) after
`Height` and `Angle`. The corners between such flanges close like those between equal ones:
the ends run toward each other the rule's gap apart, either side of the plane halfway between
the two flanges, and a taller flange's end keeps that line up to its own tip. This is how to
close a corner between flanges at different angles, because flanges of separate features
don't close toward each other. In the Flange dialog, picking more than one edge shows a row
per edge with an angle and a height box; an empty box takes the value above.

```json
{"command":"sheet.flange","params":{"edges":[[60,0,2],{"point":[120,45,2],"angle":"90 deg"},
 {"point":[60,90,2],"angle":"105 deg","height":"30 mm"},{"point":[0,45,2],"angle":"120 deg","height":"25 mm"}],
 "height":38.6,"angle":"75 deg"}}
```

For a shop drawing or spreadsheet, `sheet.export_bend_table` returns CSV by default; choose
`format: "json"` for structured data. It includes the sheet rule, thickness, bend angles,
radii, allowances and flat centre-line coordinates. Lengths use millimetres and angles use
degrees. Supply `path` to save it, or omit `path` to receive the content through the command
response. `body` defaults to the last sheet body. Exporting does not add a timeline entry or
consume an undo step.

```json
{"command":"sheet.export_bend_table","params":{"format":"csv","path":"bracket-bends.csv"}}
{"command":"sheet.export_dxf","params":{"path":"bracket-flat.dxf"}}
```

DXF cutout geometry preserves lines, circles and circular arcs; other curves are sampled
adaptively. The `OUTLINE`, `BEND_UP` and `BEND_DOWN` layers separate cuts from bend centres.

Base-flange profiles keep their interior holes. Through cuts that cross a sheet edge become
notches in the flat outline; overlapping and repeated cuts remove their combined area once.
The flat preview, DXF and unfolded solid use the same material boundaries. Lines and circular
arcs remain exact; other profile curves use a 0.001 mm chord tolerance.

Cuts can leave separate material pieces, including the centre of a ring cut. These pieces
remain one logical sheet group through Unfold / Refold and export as separate flat outlines.
Large profiles that exceed the geometry processing budget report an error instead of
exporting a partial outline.

Parallel, untapered extrude cuts also preserve shallow pockets through Unfold / Refold.
The pocket floor and side walls remain solid geometry; overlapping cuts from opposite sides
become a through hole wherever they remove the whole thickness. Flat-pattern JSON lists
`pockets` with their side, depth and bottom/top thickness coordinates in millimetres.
DXF pocket boundaries use `POCKET_BOTTOM_Z…_TO_…_MM`, `POCKET_TOP_Z…_TO_…_MM`, or
`POCKET_INTERNAL_Z…_TO_…_MM` layers. These are machining operations, so do not treat every
pocket layer as a through-cut contour when importing the drawing into a CAM tool.

Extrude Intersect on a straight base or an unfolded sheet retains the material inside both
the current tool footprint and its depth interval, including interior holes, detached islands
and earlier pockets. A shallow intersection records the removed layers above and below the
retained material as top and bottom pockets. The sheet rule keeps the original stock gauge;
the remaining solid can be thinner. A completely empty intersection removes the sheet and
its metadata together. DXF records pocket depth in its layer names; importing that DXF as
ordinary sketch geometry does not reconstruct the machining depths automatically. Each
positive retained or removed depth layer must meet the kernel's 0.000001 mm extrusion
resolution; smaller layers report an error rather than being rounded away. To Object can
retain a tool that trims to a straight prism, using its actual trimmed footprint. A curved
tool with varying depth is refused before changing sheet geometry. Pocket profiles can move with planar panels when forming,
but a pocket crossing a bend zone cannot yet be refolded. Machining folded bend material,
tapered sheet cuts and other unsupported 3D sheet Cut/Intersect operations report an error before changing
the design; they cannot silently restore removed material during a later sheet rebuild.
